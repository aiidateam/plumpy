## v0.20.0 - 2021-08-10

- üîß MAINTAIN: update requirement to `pyyaml~=5.4` (#221)
  The versions of `pyyaml` up to v5.4 contained severe security issues where the default loaders could be abused for arbitrary code execution.
  The default `FullLoader` was patched to no longer allow this behavior, but as a result, data sets that could be successfully deserialized with it, now will fail.
  This required using the unsafe `Loader` in for the deserialization of the exception state of a process.


## v0.19.0 - 2021-03-09

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è DEPRECATE: `Process.done` method:
  This method is a duplicate of `Process.has_terminated`, and is not used anywhere in plumpy (or aiida-core).

- üêõ FIX: `Task.cancel` should not set state as `EXCEPTED`
  `asyncio.CancelledError` are generated when an async task is cancelled.
  In python 3.7 this exception class inherits from `Exception`, whereas in python 3.8+ it inherits from `BaseException`.
  This meant it python 3.7 it was being caught by `except Exception`, and setting the process state to `EXCEPTED`,
  whereas in python 3.8+ it was being re-raised to the caller.
  We now ensure in both versions it is re-raised (particularly because aiida-core currently relies on this behaviour).

- üëå IMPROVE: Process broadcast subscriber
  Filter out `state_changed` broadcasts, and allow these to pass-through without generating a (costly) asynchronous task.
  Note this also required an update in the minimal kiwipy version, to `0.7.4`

## v0.18.6 - 2021-02-24

üëå IMPROVE: Catch state change broadcast timeout

When using an RMQ communicator, the broadcast can timeout on heavy loads to RMQ
(for example see <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/issues/4745>).
This broadcast is not critical to the running of the process,
and so a timeout should not except it.

Also ensure the process PID is included in all log messages.

## v0.18.5 - 2021-02-15

Minor improvements and bug fixes:

- üêõ FIX: retrieve future exception on_killed
  The exception set on the future should be retrieved, otherwise it will be caught by the loop's exception handler.
- üêõ FIX: Clean-up process event hooks:
  On Process close/cleanup event hooks are removed,
  in part to not persist cyclic dependencies of hooks <-> Process.
  Once a process is closed, it will also not raise an Exception if a hook tries to un-register itself (but has already been removed by the clean-up).
- üëå IMPROVE: Add `Process.is_killing` property
- üëå IMPROVE: remove RUNNING from allowed states of `resume`:
  Since there is no `resume` method implemented for the `Running` class.
- üîß MAINTAIN: Remove frozendict dependency
